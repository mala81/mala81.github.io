    <h1>Privacy Policy for RunningCalc</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 10, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled by the RunningCalc application (the "App") developed by Martin Larvia.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>RunningCalc is designed to be a utility that primarily operates on your device. We do not directly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, email address, location, or other contact details, unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., by emailing us for support).</p>

    <h2>2. Information Processed on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All calculations (pace, splits, etc.), presets, pace bands, and cheat sheets you create within the App are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party by the App itself.</p>

    <h2>3. App Usage Data & Settings (Local)</h2>
    <p>The App stores your settings (e.g., preferred units, max distance values) and created data (presets, pace bands) locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms (like UserDefaults or AppStorage). This data is not transmitted to us.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our landing page or an in-app notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the App to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: martin@larvia.se</p>
